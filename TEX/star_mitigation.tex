%The brightness of Thomson scattered light is very small relative to the background stars. Thus, it is important to remove all light due to stars. For the purposes of star removal, the stars are considered as outliers to the local pixel data. This assumption reduces the process of removing stars to looking for outliers in the brightness data.
