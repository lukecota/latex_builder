The initial extraction of data (brightness) is done using the SSW IDL libraries. STEREO HI, L2, 11 day background subtracted, DNS images are downloaded from \url{https://www.ukssdc.ac.uk/solar/stereo/data.html}, and the data is extracted. At the same time the data is extracted, the SSW IDL libraries are used to remove background light, and reduce light from stars. In addition to background light removal the SSW IDL libraries are used to determine the right ascension and declination of each pixel. %Further discussion of the SSW IDL routines used in this process can be found in appendix \ref{appendix_ssw}
