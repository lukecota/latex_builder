The conditioning of STEREO HI L2 data for use in IPS tomography requires multiple steps. The processing chain first requires the extraction of pixel information from the L2 data files. This is primarily done using software provided by the SolarSoftWare (SSW) IDL libraries. Once the data is extracted, the next step is to remove stars, and enhance Thomson scattered light. The final link in the processing chain is the binning and formatting of the data (into points files) for the input into the IPS tomography.
